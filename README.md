# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Movie-Reviews
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of natural language processing that involves analyzing the sentiment of a given piece of text. In this project, we will be performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB website. This will involve training a machine learning model on a dataset of movie reviews that have been labeled as either positive or negative, and then using that model to predict the sentiment of movie reviews that it has not seen before. The goal of this project is to accurately classify the sentiment of movie reviews in order to understand how people feel about a given movie.
