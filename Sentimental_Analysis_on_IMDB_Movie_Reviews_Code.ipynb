              "array([\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\",\n",
              "       'A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams\\' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master\\'s of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional \\'dream\\' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell\\'s murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.',\n",
              "       'I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I\\'d laughed at one of Woody\\'s comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I\\'ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her \"sexy\" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than \"Devil Wears Prada\" and more interesting than \"Superman\" a great comedy to go see with friends.',\n",

              "       'This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it is a little different from many I have seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly regular slasher story, but more the way the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes, but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type. Because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut-outs. Just slightly. I had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car. In the glove compartment, they find a handgun. \"Thank you, God!\" one of them happily exclaims. That guy\\'s head suddenly looks like a mannequin\\'s head, and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder, \"What is that? Where is that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?\" Then BOOM! The head explodes and I figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun. I love that scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.',\n",
              "       \"This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. Maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. To me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. At times I wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. This movie just wasn't good for me.\",\n",

distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fit and where the great strength of austen elizabeth at least in austen eye wa her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundary of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightley elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overall established her beyond doubt a spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character a written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she wa ably matched by matthew macfayden br br donald sutherland a mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationship that make mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie a the only two sensible people in world of fool wa completely lost not

start in describing where and when it go so horribly wrong looking at it now it obvious to any fan of movie that blake edward created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director had struck gold with andrew in musical mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrew wa snubbed from starring in project made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personality never knowing who or what it is some specific scene are good or effective but a whole it just doesn work at all to point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edward cut scene from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it is we are minute into it and we still don know what going on or why we re watching what going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she wa she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo thoroughly bored looking julie andrew thing aren helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why doe julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given u some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding there no catalyst in this story br br one only ha to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just came up with idea inspired by andrew and edward previous success the best or worst example is the scene when andrew and hudson follows group of child who sing in the middle of forest edward channeling sound of music it no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in that scene might have worked on certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there are other plot element directly inspired by andrew edward other film the endless scene of dogfight is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ll give you three guess wa created just to make fun of julie mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing striptease in the act the ending bird eye view of julie running towards hudson plane is another wink at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie play singer born from german father and british mother who life in england but sings her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in mid sentence m like what happened here br br the comedy bit are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where peter seller when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoot round of bullet at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that one slow moving train there br br the musical moment the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason gave this film star but it effect is diminished considerably because it repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man land is ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to group of injured soldier at french hospital making me wonder how many soldier there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying br br the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie look dazed like she on valium but what really kill this ill conceived project is julie playing german spy edward desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing traitor wa good career decision a much a like julie she no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play german spy she

unpleasant character in sight even the villain are riveting character but they re colourful they re eclectic and they re idiosyncratic and the array of character is also gargantuan for lack of better term only adding the rich layer of distinctiveness already plastered onto bug life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan a seen in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season harvest with his antic br br the problem arises in the fact that the ant harvest is for bunch of greedy grasshopper led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of better term hopper offer proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack hand however it a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in flik mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshopper br br if you think about it bug life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemy one lone village dweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in bug life the help come in the form of down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik a warrior in bar room brawl br br much amusement come out of these scene and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and quasi femme fatale ladybug who in fact gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it exceedingly enjoyable watching these bug on screen a it is watching the bug and the insect interact on screen a is the entire movie collectively br br a ve said much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another which give way to bevy of hilarious line wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall dazzling movie what make bug life even better is that the film isn restricted simply to child a many may perceive it to be although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clichÃ©d kid friendly situation are bit more abundant than we like however it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this film br br although bug life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by it predecessor this is still superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they re not just one hit wonder but instead much gifted and talented group of film artist in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standard it only always by themselves what more is there to say about bug life other than see it it not quite the best which we ve seen from the folk at emeryville california but this beat out the lot of it year and ll be damned if this isn the best animated feature of br br 5',\n",

              " 'i thought that rotj wa clearly the best out of the three star war movie find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj wa the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprise most emotional especially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie personally like the empire strike back lot also but think it is slightly le good than than rotj since it wa slower moving wa not a episodic and just did not feel a much suspense or emotion a did with the third movie br br it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising review that the reason people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reason compared to the sheer excellence of the film a whole have heard many strange reason such a because yoda died because bobba fett died because small ewoks defeated band of stormtroopers because darth vader wa revealed br br would like to debunk each of these reason because believe that they miss the point completely first off who care if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die don get me wrong am fan of bobba fett but he made few cameo appearance and it wa not lucas intention to make him central character in the film that star war fan made him out to be his name wa not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credit to find out bobba fett name judging rotj because minor character died is bit much think secondly many fan did not like yoda dying sure it wa momentous period in the movie wa not happy to see him die either but it make the movie more realistic all the good guy can stay alive in realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guy lived and all the bad guy died this movie would have been tantamount to cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in new hope many consider new hope to be the best of the trilogy why wa obi wan death okay but yoda not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason just can not believe wa even stated wa because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactic the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers wa through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vine rope log set up to trip those walker and other trap the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantage of the forest the only thing they had wa their blaster to add it wa not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebel in that conquest thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated combination of the star war hero the band of rebel a well a the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been great upset lastly if this scene wa still unbelievable to you how about in empire strike back or in new hope where there were several scene of group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blaster missed while the hero were in full view and not only that the hero of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blaster the trooper must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strike back the battle of endor wa much more believable since you had two army pitted each other not hero against legion of stormtroopers don believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our hero were escaping lando base or when our hero were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missed a han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star br br the last reason that care to discus others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many way that wa major part of the plot in the movie luke wa trying to find whether or not darth vader wa his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father face because it made it complete by annakin revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he wa annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene wa about in fact that is what would have done in that scene too if were luke father isn that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eye before you died and not in mechanized helmet br br on another note think subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movie is another reason that rotj doe not get a many accolade a it deserves never go into film with that deception in mind always try to go into film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but can not know for sure let see that way go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that clearly superior film is not a good a it really wa br br am not sure who criticizes these movie but have asked many college student and adult about which is their favorite star war movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that new hope wa their favorite that it is rotj believe that the result on these poll are appalling and quite misleading br br bottom line the return of the jedi wa the best of the trilogy this movie wa the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout it minute there wa not moment of boredom because each scene wa either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj wa better than the one in the empire strike back any day br br finally hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fan start looking for nitpicky insignificant detail or see it a just another sequel to trash the movie such a this movie stink because luke is not in it then this

etc now this movie hold special place in my heart already despite me being only year old at the time of writing this review because of my style early childhood watched many tv show and saw many movie that other kid didn see and this movie wa one of those and one of the greatest too br br it start off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk adoptive father is in rush to get to the airport a he is going on business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunk help him pack while they are talking alvin express his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify a the world david is leaving the chipmunk in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boy soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunk are left at home with miss miller later at local cafÃ© the chipmunk are playing game of around the world in day against the chipettes brittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by crocodile alvin get in an argument with brittany about who would really win race around the world two diamond smuggler sitting at nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing safe way of transporting their diamond over the world decide to fool the child into delivering them for them they set up race around the world where each team will have to deposit doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamond at drop offs around the world and receive doll in the opposing team likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamond to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who ha been hot on their heel for some time now would never suspect them because they are just kid however this seems to be redundant because on their travel the kid do not have to go through any security check and are never even questioned about the doll suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamond there personally and so begin great adventure this film is classic and see no reason why anyone would not like it it feature great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick as music pardon my french my favorite song is without shred of doubt the girl and boy of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it also my favorite moment in the film other notable song include getting lucky kind of suggestive for kid film eh and my mother a well a wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credit performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky first didn think anything of it but when grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song wa little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animator insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panty this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince men when eleanor lean over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this doe nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained thing like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are foot tall chipmunk walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voice and treat them just like they would any human child anyway bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamond in the doll and decide to go find the chipmunk and get home the direction of janice karman perfect this movie a she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the character better than anyone they even do the voice of the chipmunk and the chipettes ross doing the voice for alvin and simon a well a dave and janice doing the voice for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male character that are voiced by female voice actress nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson make an appearance in this movie she play the part of the arabian prince very small but important role the ending is of course happy one the crook have been caught the loose end tied and the film end when the child dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yell alvin and the screen fade to black br br classic ending by the way hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you
